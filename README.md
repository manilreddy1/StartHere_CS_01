Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption in Python
Overview
This project implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each character in the text by a fixed number (shift value) to encrypt the message.

Features
Encrypt a message by shifting each character forward.
Decrypt a message by reversing the shift on each character.
Allows users to specify the shift value.
