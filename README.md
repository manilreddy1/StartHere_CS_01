# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption in Python

## Overview
This project implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each character in the text by a fixed number (shift value) to encrypt the message.

## Features
- Encrypt a message by shifting each character forward.
- Decrypt a message by reversing the shift on each character.
- Allows users to specify the shift value.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manilreddy1/caesar-cipher.git
